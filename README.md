This repository contains a project related to movie previews. It includes a web application that allows users to browse and watch movie trailers, read movie reviews, and explore upcoming movie releases. The project aims to provide an interactive and engaging platform for movie enthusiasts to discover new films and stay updated on the latest releases.

The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, React, with integration to The MovieDB (TMDb), The Open Movie Database (OMDb), and YouTube API's for fetching movie data. Users can search for specific movies, view detailed information about each movie, and watch trailers directly on the platform.

Feel free to explore the various features of the project and contribute to its development.
